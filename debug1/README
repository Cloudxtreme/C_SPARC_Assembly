Compilation Errors (2):
-----------------------

1)  The first compilation error was found when running make for the first time.
    The output of this make command can be seen below:
    ___________________________________________________________________________
    Assembling each assembly source file separately ...
    gcc -c -g reverse.s
    /usr/bin/as: "reverse.s", line 29: error: location counter not on word 
    boundary

    *** Error code 1
    make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `reverse.o'
    ___________________________________________________________________________

    We never declared where the text section begins for this assembly
    file, so .section ".text" was added on line 13, after the data section,
    where palStr is defined.


2) After fixing the first compilation error, the second compilation error was
   found when running the make command again. The output of this make command
   can be seen below:
   ____________________________________________________________________________
   Assembling each assembly source file separately ...
   gcc -c -g reverse.s

   Assembling each assembly source file separately ...
   gcc -c -g swapChars.s

   Assembling each assembly source file separately ...

   gcc -o reverseString -g -Wall main.o reverse.o swapChars.o findEnd.o
   ld: fatal: relocation error: R_SPARC_13: file reverse.o: symbol .data
   (section): value 0x21100 does not fit
   collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
   *** Error code 1
   make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `reverseString'
   ____________________________________________________________________________

   The compilation error given here is a relocation error: R_SPARC_13. This
   error occurs when we are using a mov instruction where a set instruction is
   needed on a label or large constant greater than +/- 4k (from CSE30
   website-useful links page, yes I read all these links Prof Ord! Thank you,
   there are invaluable).

   After combing through reverse.s, since the line number was not specified
   in the compilation error where we had an incorrect use of mov instruction,
   I found the error on line 73. On this line we are attempting to move the
   label palStr label into the %o0 register with a mov instruction. To fix this
   I simply changed it from a mov to a set instruction.

   After fixing this error, make runs and there are no more compilation erros. 


Runtime & Functionality Errors (6):
-----------------------------------

1) The first error I found quickly using VDB was in reverse.s, where the save
   instruction is not implemented correctly. There is a missing minus sign,
   after correcting this error, line 31 is as follows:

   	save	%sp, -(92+4) & -8, %sp

2) After fixing the first error, making again, then running the program with a
   test string, I received a bus error (core dumped). So I ran the current
   program with gdb, ran it with the same test argument, the program crashed 
   gdb reported a Seg-fault in the findEnd() function. 

   Opening findEnd.s, the first thing I noticed is a missing save call at the
   beginning of the function. This was remedied by add the line below on line 
   24, right after where "findEnd:" is.

   	save	%sp, -96, %sp

3) After fixing the second error, making again, and running the program with a
   test string, I still received a Seg-fault somewhere in findEnd instruction
   area. Upon closer inspection with GDB, I noticed that on line 29 of 
   findEnd.s, we are trying to load a byte into a register using the ld 
   instruction, where we should be using the ldub  instruction. So line 29 is 
   as follows now:

   	ldub	[%i0], %l0

4) After fixing the third error, making again, and running the program with a
   test string, I was receiving a bus error (core dumped). Upon closer
   inspection with GDB, I set a breakpoint in the findEnd() function and 
   ran the program with GDB and stepped through. Unlike with the third error
   previously, I was able to step through until I hit some instruction that
   caused a Seg-fault somewhere in the checkChar instructions. 

   Same as before, on line 40 of findEnd.s, we are using ld instruction to load
   a char, when we should be using the ldub instruction. Line 40 is as follows
   now:

	ldub 	[%i0], %l0


5) After fixing the fifth error, making again, and running the program with a
   test string, I was receiving a Seg-fault. Upon close inspection with GDB
   I noticed that the when I was stepping through the program, I was stuck in
   an endless loop. The function with a for-loop is in reverse(). After
   scanning through the code I noticed that on line 59 of reverse.s, that 
   endptr was not being decremented properly. Instead of subtracting, the
   instruction was using add. Line 59 of reverse.s now reads:

	sub	%l2, 1, %l2

6) After fixing the fifth error, making again, and running the program with a
   test string, the program worked. However, when I ran the program with
   multiple string input arguments, such as "abba was a band with some serious
   wow factor", the program was repeatedly checking if abba was a palindrome 
   the same number of times as there are arguments. After inspecting with GDB,
   I found the error in main.c on line 42, where we are reading the argument
   string from argv[]. After fixing this error, line 42 looks as follows:

   	char* str = argv[i]  // Was incorrectly argv[1], hence abba was checked
			     // several times.

6a) Although this had no adverse affect on the program, I found that missing 
    nop instruction after line 44 of swapChar.s, where we are branching always
    to notSame.
   	
After fixing these errors, the program runs successfully, and returns the
correct output if a test string is a palindrome or not, and works great with a 
single string input or multiple string input.
