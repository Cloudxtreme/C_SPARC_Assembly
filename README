Description
-----------

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a
multi-threaded functions and how they are faster than functions that are
not multi-threaded, given a large sample size. The array, generally very large,
is initialized with random values (within a range of -128 to 127). The 
non-threaded function sequentially squares all the elements of the array and
sums then up, while this operation is timed. The mult-threaded function,
partitions the array into 8 partitions, calling the same square and sum 
function as before, but on smaller array sizes. However, these 8 threads ares
occuring simultaneously. Also the multi-threaded function is timed as well. The
progrm prints out the running time of the sequential, non-threaded version and
the running time of the multi-threaded version, aslo the factor of how much
faster the multi-threaded applicaiton was. 

How to compile
--------------

Navigate tot he program directory (pamt1), and through the use of the provided
Makefile, type "make" to compile the program. For more instructions on what
targets the Makefile can produce, please inspect the contents of the Makefile
file. Use "make clean" to clean the directory of compiled files.

How to run
----------	

After successful compilation an executable "squaredSumMinMax" is created. Run
the program by typing "./squaredSumMinMax" follwed by one integer argument,
which is the size of the test array you wish to initialized and fill with
random integers within the range of -128 to 127, which then all the elements of
this array will be sqaured and added together in the non-threaded sequential
way , and then in the multi-threaded way. 

example terminal command:	./squaredSumMinMax 8675309

Normal Output
-------------

Normal output is printed to stdout (therefore the tereminal). An example of a
successfull output is:

[cs30xix@ieng6-202]:pamt1$ ./squaredSumMinMax 500000000
Initializing array (size = 500000000) with random values

............. Done

Sequential squared sum, min, max (be patient)
Squared Sum is: 2722614736804
Min value is: -128
Max value is: 127
Completed in 1.809914 sec

Async-get parallel squared sum, min, max
Number of threads = 8
Squared Sum is: 2722614736804
Min value is: -128
Max value is: 127
Completed in 0.335405 sec

Speed-up: 5.396205

Abnormal Output
---------------

Abnormal output is printed to stderr. Unfortunately, there is no input argument
validation for correct data type (since main was not fully coded by me, only
the TODO areas). However, if no argument is passed in to the prgram then the
usage error is printed to stderr, which can be seen below:

cs30xix@ieng6-202]:pamt1$ ./squaredSumMinMax

Usage: ./squaredSumMinMax array_size
   array_size  (must be positive integer)


If a negative integer is passed in as an argument, then the program crashes due
to a segmentation fault, as seen below: (argument was -500000)

[cs30xix@ieng6-202]:pamt1$ ./squaredSumMinMax -500000
Initializing array (size = -500000) with random values

 Done

Sequential squared sum, min, max (be patient)
Segmentation fault

Testing
-------

The program was tested by running the program with various random non-negative
array_size inputs. Upon successful running og the program, we expect to see
Normal Output behavior, meaning that the sequential and mult-threaded function
run times were printed out to the terminal. For array sizes that were of a 
large magnitude, we expect to see a discernable speed-up on the multi-threaded 
operations, whereas array sizes of a small magnitude, we would not notice a

Questions:
----------

1) When I ran the program with an input array size of 500,000,000, the program
   outputted a 5.300547 speed-up, when using 8 threads. The sequential runtime 
   was 1.774199 seconds and the async-get parallel runtime was 0.334720 
   seconds.

   When I ran the prgram with an input array size of 500, the program outputted
   a 0.000879 speed-up, when using 8 threads. The sequential runtime was 
   0.00000 seconds and the async-get parallel runtime was 0.003413 seconds.

   The sequential computing runtime was much for the small array size because 
   there is an overhead time expenditure when setting up multiple threads, and
   therefore 8 simultaneous stack frames (since the programs is calling the
   sequentialSquaredSumMinMax() function 8 times simultaneously). The 
   sequential computing runtime does not have this overhead time expenditure 
   and only sets up 1 stack frame, since the program calls the 
   sequentialSquaredSumMinMax function once. Therefore parallel processing is 
   better for very large arrays, and sequential processing is better for small
   arrays. 


2) I noticed that the speedup was around ~1.00 (+/- 0.2) when the input array
   size was within the range of 1,900,000. 

   For five cosectuive runs of the program, with an input size array of
   1,900,000 I got the following speed-up's:

   	1) 0.911720
	2) 1.158520
	3) 1.013164
	4) 1.042169
	5) 0.847657

   Taking the average of these speed-up values (of size 5 sample), I got a
   speed-up of 0.994646. Pretty darn close to a speed-up of 1.0!!!
