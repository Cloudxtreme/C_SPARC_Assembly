Description
-----------

This is an interactive program that allows the user to build anagram databases
specified upon their dictionary file input, and allows users to search for
anagrams within the anagram database that was previously built. The program
will continuously ask the user to search for a new anagram in the database, 
until the user enters ctrl-D (^D).

How to compile
--------------

Navigate to the program directory (pa3), and through the use of the provided
Makefile, type "make" to compile the program. For more instructions on 
what the Makefile can do please view "Makefile" file (other targets).
Use "make clean" to clean the directory of compiled files.

How to run
----------	

First compile the the program, resulting in the compilation of the
"anagrams" executable. 

The easiest way to see how this program works, since it there are a several
command line arguments is to run the program with the "-h" flag to show
usage instruction of the program (as seen below).

example terminal command: 	

	./anagrams -h
	./anagrams -d /usr/dict/words

Normal Output
-------------

Normal output is printed to stdout (therefore the terminal screen). An example
of a successfull normal output is:


[cs30xyz@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams ­d /usr/dict/words
Anagram database file "anagram_database.db" built.

[cs30xix@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: spot
Anagram(s) are: post spot stop
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: ^D

[cs30xix@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: minced
No anagrams found.
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: ^D

[cs30xix@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams ­h
usage: ./anagrams [­d dict_name [­o db_dest]] | [­s db_src] | [­h]
Interactive anagram search.
Startup:
­h print long usage.
Build Database:
­d <dict_name> source dictionary for database creation.
­o <db_dest> custom database file name.
Find Anagrams:
­s <db_src> path to custom source database file.

Abnormal Output
---------------

Abnormal output is expected when the command line flags for the program 
are invalid, meaning there are too few, too many, or mutually exclusive 
flags, or when the flags do not have any arguments that go with them.

Some example of abnormal output can be seen below:

[cs30xix@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams extra
Extra operand 'extra'.
Try './anagrams ­h' for more information.

[cs30xix@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams ­d /usr/dict/words extra1 extra2
Extra operand 'extra1'.
Try './anagrams ­h' for more information.

[cs30xix@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams ­d /usr/dict/words ­s custom
Build flags (­d, ­o) and find anagrams flags (­s) are mutually exclusive.
Try './anagrams ­h' for more information.

[cs30xyz@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams ­d fake_file
fake_file: No such file or directory
Try './anagrams ­h' for more information.

[cs30xyz@ieng9]:pa3$ ./anagrams ­d no_perm
no_perm: Permission denied
Try './anagrams ­h' for more information.

There are many more errors, some of the others are listed in PA3 Assignment
PDF at the following URL:

Testing
-------

The program was tested by writing many unit tests for the majority of the 
functions. Furthermore, the program was tested by visually checking the
difference between this program and the sample program. 

NOTE: This program compiles and works with SOME errors. The parseArgs()
function is hurting very much. However, on the bright side, the program
can build an angram database from a supplied dictionary, and the program
can successfully search for anagrams (with one minor error with an erroneous
help string printed on occasion).

Questions:
----------

1) I maintain my integrity when pushed to my mental and physical limits by not
   giving in to th easy method of cheating or copying. For me the journey and
   knowledge attained on the way is the reward. Even though I am very
   agitated and livid that my program is not working as it should 100%, I
   never gave in to taking the easy way out and sacrificing my integrity.
   This program has been the bane of my existence for the last week and a
   half, however, I have learned immensely from this program and experience.

   Even when the going gets really really tough, it is in everyone's best 
   interest to maintain their integrity, even when they are facing inevitable
   doom. Learn from the journey and the mistakes you made, and do better
   next time by never repeating them.
